Create Purchasing Information and Receipts for Lovely Loveseats
We’ve decided to pursue the dream of small-business ownership and open up a furniture store called Lovely Loveseats for Neat Suites on Fleet Street. With our newfound knowledge of Python programming, we’re going to build a system to help speed up the process of creating receipts for your customers.

In this project, we will be storing the names and prices of a furniture store’s catalog in variables. You will then process the total price and item list of customers, printing them to the output terminal.

Please note: Projects do not run tests against your code. This experience is more open to your interpretation and gives you the freedom to explore. Remember that all variables must be declared before they are referenced in your code.
