1. Write a function called f_to_c that takes an input f_temp, a temperature in Fahrenheit, and converts it to c_temp, that temperature in Celsius.

It should then return c_temp.

The equation you should use is:

Define a variable f100_in_celsius and set it equal to the value of f_to_c with 100 as an input.

Write a function called c_to_f that takes an input c_temp, a temperature in Celsius, and converts it to f_temp, that temperature in Fahrenheit.

5.
Define a function called get_force that takes in mass and acceleration. It should return mass multiplied by acceleration.

Test get_force by calling it with the variables train_mass and train_acceleration.

Define a function called get_energy that takes in mass and c.

get_energy should return mass multiplied by c squared.
